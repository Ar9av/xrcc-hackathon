## Track 1 - Mixed Reality (MR) [Meta sponsored]

Meta leads the way in mixed reality technology.

They're looking for fresh ideas for Quest headsets and wearables. 

This track is for creators building next-gen mixed reality, from innovative games to tools that blend digital and physical worlds.

Meta wants innovative approaches and potential developers to join their ecosystem.

It's your chance to showcase projects to the team behind spatial computing for millions worldwide.

### Inspiration 1 - Full mixed reality experience

**Focus: Blend Digital and Physical Worlds**

Build a mixed reality experience that fully utilizes Quest's capabilities - passthrough, room understanding, hand tracking, spatial anchors. Create something where the digital and physical worlds enhance each other. Meta wants to see what happens when you design for MR-first, not VR with passthrough tacked on.

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Room-aware experiences**: Use furniture, walls, floors, and ceiling as part of your design
- **Persistent spatial content**: Place digital objects that stay in your real space across sessions
- **Hand tracking interaction**: Natural hand interactions that feel better than controllers
- **Physical + digital gameplay**: Mechanics that require both real and virtual elements
- **Contextual experiences**: Apps that adapt based on your actual environment

**Why this works:**

Meta leads the way in mixed reality technology. They're looking for fresh ideas that show what Quest can do when you design for the physical world, not against it. This is the track for creators building next-gen mixed reality - innovative games and tools that blend digital and physical worlds naturally.

**What to focus on:**

- **MR-first design**: Built for mixed reality from the ground up, not VR with passthrough added
- **Room understanding**: Does it actually use your physical space meaningfully?
- **Hand tracking**: Natural interactions that feel effortless
- **Showcase potential**: Projects that demonstrate what's possible to Meta's XR team

### Inspiration 2 - Full Virtual Reality

**Focus: Full Virtual Reality**

Create a fully immersive VR experience that takes advantage of complete presence in virtual space. Build games or tools where being completely removed from the physical world is the point. Show what's possible when you control every aspect of the environment.

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Total immersion gameplay**: Experiences that work best when you forget the real world
- **Impossible spaces**: Environments that couldn't exist physically - anti-gravity, scale shifts, impossible architecture
- **Deep presence**: Mechanics that require full focus and immersion
- **VR-native interaction**: Controller or hand interactions designed for virtual-only contexts
- **Atmospheric worlds**: Environments where mood, presence, and immersion are everything

**Why this works:**

Sometimes the real world is the limitation. Classic VR lets you create experiences that would be impossible in mixed reality - complete control over lighting, scale, physics, and atmosphere. Meta wants to see what creators build when they're not constrained by physical space.

**What to focus on:**

- **Presence and immersion**: Does it make people forget they're wearing a headset?
- **VR-native design**: Built specifically for virtual reality, not portable to other platforms
- **Polish and performance**: Smooth 90fps+ experience that maintains presence
- **Unique value**: Something that wouldn't work as well in MR or flat screen

### Inspiration 3 - Build Your Own MR/VR Concept

**Focus: Your Vision for Spatial Computing**

Build whatever you think showcases the potential of Quest headsets and wearables. Use any combination of MR, VR, hand tracking, controllers, or new interaction models. Meta wants innovative approaches from potential developers joining their ecosystem - this is your chance to showcase your project to the team behind spatial computing for millions worldwide.

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Hybrid MR/VR**: Switch between or combine both modes meaningfully
- **Novel interactions**: New ways to use hands, controllers, or voice
- **Tools and utilities**: Practical applications that solve real problems
- **Experimental concepts**: Test new ideas for spatial computing
- **Cross-device experiences**: Projects that work across Quest headsets and future wearables

**Why this works:**

The best ideas often come from creators exploring their own vision without constraints. Meta is looking for innovative approaches and potential developers to join their ecosystem. Show them something they haven't seen before.

**What to focus on:**

- **Innovation**: Are you doing something new or approaching problems differently?
- **Technical execution**: Does it demonstrate strong development skills?
- **Clear vision**: Can you articulate why this matters and where it could go?
- **Ecosystem fit**: Does this showcase Quest's unique capabilities?

## Track 2 - Horizon Worlds [Meta sponsored]

Meta's putting serious money behind Horizon Worlds - **$50 million funding opportunity** that's actively looking for creators.

**This market is still wide open.** Most people haven't figured out how to build sustainable businesses here yet, which means there's real opportunity for those who move now.

**Meta's actively rewarding creators who get in early.** They need content, experiences, and worlds that keep people coming back.

It's one of the few spaces where you can still build something meaningful without massive competition.

**If you've been thinking about VR creation, this might be your window.**

### Inspiration 1 - Mobile Gaming

**Focus: Horizon Worlds on Mobile Devices**

Create a mobile-first Horizon World optimized for touch controls and mobile gaming habits. Meta's $50M funding program is actively looking for mobile creators - build something that could scale to millions.

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Touch-native design**: Controls that feel natural on mobile - no awkward virtual joysticks
- **Quick sessions**: 5-15 minute gameplay that fits commutes and breaks
- **Genre focus**: Pick one and nail it - Party Games, Obby/Platformer, or Adventure
- **Cross-platform magic**: Design experiences where mobile and VR users play together - mobile players bring accessibility, VR players bring immersion
- **Social-first**: Works solo, shines with friends

**Why this works:**

Mobile gaming is huge, but VR experiences feel clunky on phones. There's a gap between what mobile users expect and what's available. The real opportunity? Mobile + VR users in the same world together. Mobile players expand your audience to millions, VR players bring the "wow" factor. Meta needs creators who understand both.

**What to focus on:**

- **Performance**: Runs smoothly on older phones
- **Instant onboarding**: Users get it within 20 seconds
- **Cross-platform balance**: Both mobile and VR users have fun, neither feels like second-class
- **Sustainable**: Could be long-term, not just a hackathon project

### Inspiration 1 - Social Experience

**Focus: Social Spaces & Experiences**

Design a Horizon World that excels at bringing people together in social settings. Create spaces and experiences that encourage meaningful interactions between players. Meta's $50M creator fund prioritizes social engagement - they want worlds where people spend time together, not just pass through.

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Social space design**: Environments that naturally encourage group formation - cozy conversation areas, shared activity zones, collaboration spaces
- **Natural social mechanics**: Use Custom UI and intuitive controls to make social interactions feel effortless - easy gestures, sharing, communication
- **Cross-genre social elements**: Add social features to any genre - make your Party Game, Roleplay, or Adventure inherently social
- **Retention hooks**: Design experiences that give people reasons to come back together

**Why this works:**

Most VR social experiences leave people standing around not knowing what to do or how to interact naturally. Meta's "Best Social Experience" award specifically looks for worlds that use space design to bring people together effectively. Social connections are the strongest retention driver.

**What to focus on:**

- **Natural interaction**: People should intuitively know how to connect and engage
- **Space design**: Does your environment encourage people to gather and interact?
- **Multiple awards**: A great social world can win "Best Social Experience" plus genre and technical categories
- **Document your design**: Explain how your space brings people together and creates lasting connections

### Inspiration 3 - Your Vision for Virtual Worlds

Build whatever you think needs building in virtual worlds or social gaming. Use Horizon's tools to create something that brings people together in ways that weren't possible before. The most interesting virtual experiences won't copy the physical world - they'll be things that could only exist in virtual space.

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Social experiences**: How do people want to connect, play, or create together in virtual worlds? What new forms of interaction are waiting to be discovered?
- **Mobile-first worlds**: What works better on mobile than desktop? How do you design for touch, portability, and quick sessions?
- **Creative expression**: What tools do people need to build or share their ideas in virtual space? How do you make world-building accessible?
- **Virtual-native concepts**: What becomes possible when physics and geography aren't constraints?

**Why this works:**

Virtual worlds are still figuring out what they want to be. Most are either empty tech demos or trying to recreate real life. What becomes possible when you can build any environment or social interaction you can imagine? Meta wants to see what creators build when given complete freedom with Horizon's tools.

**What to focus on:**

- **Think virtual first**: Don't recreate real-world experiences - build something that only makes sense virtually
- **Make it social**: The best virtual worlds are about people, not places - how do you encourage genuine connection?
- **Design for mobile**: Most people experience this on phones - make that feel natural, not limited
- **Build for community**: Create something that gets better with more people, not just bigger

## Track 3 - AI and Camera access [Meta sponsored]

Their passthrough camera access opens up countless unexplored use cases.

Meta's helping creators like you who want to take their hackathon project all the way.

Polish it, publish it to the store, maybe even turn it into a real business.

Something you built that works, but needs more time to become something real.

### Inspiration 1 - **AI Spatial Assistants (Quest/MR Headsets)**

**Focus: Camera Access + AI for Immersive Environments**

Build an AI system that understands and enhances your spatial environment. Use scene understanding, object recognition, and AI reasoning to create assistants that exist in mixed reality and actually help with real-world tasks.

**Ideas to explore:**

Think about how AI can interact with your physical space in ways that weren't possible before. What becomes useful when AI can see what you see and exist in the same room as you? How can spatial computing make AI more helpful, creative, or intelligent?

**Why this works:**

Meta is betting big on AI + spatial computing. Applications that understand and reason about real environments are the missing piece. Strong implementations here get noticed by Meta's AI team.

**What to focus on:**

- **Real value**: Does the AI actually help, or is it just showing off camera access?
- **Natural interaction**: Voice + spatial feels intuitive, not clunky
- **Performance**: AI responses need to be fast enough to be useful
- **Spatial integration**: How does the AI exist in your physical space?

### Inspiration 2 - AI Companions for Wearables (Ray-Ban/Smart Glasses Focus)

**Focus: Always-On AI for Daily Life**

Design AI experiences for all-day wearable devices like Meta Ray-Ban glasses. Think lightweight, contextual, and hands-free. You can simulate this on Quest even if you don't have the hardware - build for where we're going, not just where we are.

**Ideas to explore:**

What works when you're wearing AI all day instead of putting on a headset for a session? How does always-on camera access change what's possible? What's useful in quick moments throughout your day vs longer focused sessions?

**Why this works:**

Wearable AI glasses are Meta's next frontier. They need developers thinking about always-on, contextual AI before the display versions ship. Building for this now puts you ahead of the curve - you're designing for 2026, not 2025.

**What to focus on:**

- **Lightweight design**: Works in 30-second bursts, not 30-minute sessions
- **Hands-free first**: Designed for voice and minimal interaction
- **Context awareness**: Uses what it sees to be more helpful
- **Battery conscious**: Doesn't kill the device in 2 hours
- **Socially appropriate**: Can be used in public without looking weird

### Inspiration 3 - AI-Powered Spatial Creativity

**Focus: Generative AI + Real-World Input**

Combine AI generation with real-world camera input to create something impossible without both. Use your environment as canvas, input, or inspiration for AI to generate experiences, visuals, stories, or interactions.

**Ideas to explore:**

- Systems that transform your environment through AI interpretation
- Generative experiences that use physical space as creative input
- AI collaborators where environment and imagination merge
- Tools that let you manipulate reality through AI generation
- Experiences where the real world becomes the prompt

**Why this works:**

Consumer entertainment is where XR gets traction. Creative AI tools that use your real environment are instantly shareable. Meta needs content that shows what's possible when you combine their AI stack with spatial computing.

**What to focus on:**

- **Wow factor**: Does it make people want to try it immediately?
- **Actual creativity**: Is the user creating something, or just watching AI?
- **Shareability**: Can people easily show what they made?
- **Technical execution**: Does it run smoothly while processing AI + camera feed?

### Inspiration 4 - **Your Vision Using AI + Spatial Understanding**

Create your own application that combines AI and camera access in ways we haven't thought of. Solve a problem, create an experience, or build something experimental.

**Your project should demonstrate:**

- Meaningful use of camera access (not just background passthrough)
- AI that adds real intelligence (not just decorative features)
- Clear understanding of who this is for and why they'd use it
- Technical execution that shows you can ship this

**Why this works:**

The best ideas come from people solving their own problems or exploring their own interests. Meta wants to see what developers create when given these tools without constraints.

**What to focus on:**

- **Novel combinations**: Are you doing something we haven't seen before?
- **Polish**: Even experimental projects should feel intentional
- **Demonstration**: Can you clearly show why AI + camera makes this better?
- **Feasibility**: Is this something that could actually ship?

## Track 4 - Immersive Travel & Destinations

DZT (German National Tourist Board) is backing creators who want to reimagine how people discover and experience destinations.

This track is for projects that blend travel, tourism, and immersive technology. 

Think virtual destination previews, cultural heritage or nature experiences, interactive travel guides, or tourism apps that help people get inspired to travel to Germany in new ways.

**Tourism is changing.** People want to feel connected to a place before they visit, discover hidden gems locals know about, and experience culture in deeper ways. XR makes that possible.

Whether you're building for Quest, Vision Pro, or AR platforms, DZT wants to see how you can make **inspiration** for **travel more immersive, accessible, and meaningful.

If you care about places, culture, and helping people explore the world, this is your track

### Inspiration 1 - The Future of Travel in Virtual Worlds

**Focus: Meta Horizon Worlds + other virtual worlds platforms**

Build experiences that position Germany in virtual worlds where millions already spend time. Think beyond simple tourism promos - create experiences that make people feel connected to Germany before they ever visit.

**Ideas to explore**

- Virtual German cities or cultural landmarks in e.g. Horizon Worlds with gamification
- Interactive travel experiences in that blend education + entertainment
- Social spaces where people can "meet" before traveling together to Germany
- Virtual events tied to real German festivals or cultural moments

**Why this works**

Virtual world platforms (in general) get better and better. It creates real value for DZT's brand awareness goals. DZT is actively experimenting with Horizon Worlds right now, and Meta is investing heavily in improving the platform. Both sponsors have real interest in supporting strong projects from this track - this isn't theoretical.

**What to focus on**

- Engagement time (aim for 5+ minutes)
- Emotional connection to Germany (not just cool graphics)
- Social/multiplayer features that encourage sharing

### Inspiration 2 - AI + Immersive Tech for Personalized Travel

**Focus: AI Persona + XR Experiences**

DZT has EMMA as their AI travel influencer. How can you bring AI into immersive experiences? Combine AI personalization with XR to create travel inspiration that feels tailored to each person.

**Ideas to explore**

- AI Avatar as a voice-guided AR travel guide for inspiration, and planning
- AI-powered virtual tour guide in VR that adapts to your interests
- Chatbot that recommends destinations, then lets you preview them in 3D/VR
- Personalized destination experiences based on travel preferences

**Why this works**

Combines two cutting-edge technologies, addresses multiple DZT requests at once, and creates genuinely useful pre-travel experiences.

**What to focus on**

- Make sure AI adds real value (not just a gimmick)
- Show at least 3 different personalized scenarios
- Keep it natural and helpful (not cringe)

### Inspiration 3 - Accessible Immersive Previews

**Focus: Cross-platform destination experiences**

Most people don't have VR headsets yet. Build travel preview experiences that work everywhere - Quest, Vision Pro, phone AR, WebXR, Smart Glasses.

**Ideas to explore**

- German city photogrammetry/Gaussian Splat experiences accessible on multiple devices
- WebXR travel previews that work in browsers and scale to headsets
- AR filters that bring German destinations to your location
- 2D-to-3D conversion tools that make DZT's massive content library immersive

**Why this works**

Reaches the widest audience, solves DZT's content transformation challenge, demonstrates real business value beyond just VR enthusiasts.

**What to focus on**

- Works on at least 2 platforms
- Quality doesn't tank on mobile/web
- Has a fallback for users without XR devices

### Inspiration 4 - Build Your Own

**What is the problem we are solving?**

Create your own solution that helps people discover and connect with Germany before they visit. Your approach is up to you - just make sure it solves a real pre-travel problem (inspiration, research, or planning phase).

**Your project should answer:**

1. **Who is this for?** Define your target traveler (age, interests, travel style)
2. **When would they use it?** Where does this fit in the travel journey? (Inspiration → Research → Planning)
3. **How many people can access it?** Can they use it on devices they already own? Or does it require expensive hardware? Cross-platform reach is valuable.
4. **Why would DZT care?** Show the business case. Why is this better than their current marketing?
5. **Does it actually inspire travel?** Cool tech is great, but would this make someone want to visit Germany?

**Tips for success:**

- Start with the travel problem, not the tech
- Test on people who aren't XR enthusiasts
- Show emotion, not just features (why does this matter?)
- If using AI, make sure it adds real value vs static content
- If building for virtual worlds, aim for 5+ minutes of engagement
- If cross-platform, ensure quality doesn't tank on mobile/web

**Beyond XRCC:**

Strong projects can lead to working directly with DZT on tourism innovation, presenting at major conferences, potential contracts for future XR experiences, and introductions to destination marketing organizations across Germany.

## Track 5 - Immersive Film & Storytelling

**L1VE is backing creators who want to push the boundaries of immersive storytelling.**

Whether it's 360° video, 180° 3D content, or spatial narratives on Vision Pro, this track is for filmmakers and creators who see XR as the next frontier for storytelling.

**L1VE** wants to see your best work in immersive film - whether that's documentary, fiction, experimental, or something that doesn't fit any category yet.

**If you're a creator who thinks in scenes, frames, and stories, this is your track.**

### Inspiration 1 - The 360° Cinematic Experience

Create a compelling max 2 min immersive film using 360° video capture. Focus on cinematic storytelling where the viewer is placed at the center of your narrative.

**Focus: 360°  Video Capture**

Create a compelling 2-minute immersive film using 360° video. Focus on cinematic storytelling where the viewer is at the center of your narrative. 

**Ideas to explore:**

- 360° documentary short capturing a unique cultural moment or human story
- Music video that uses the full spherical canvas to enhance the immersion
- "You are there" experience that transports viewers to an impossible or remarkable location
- Narrative short where the viewer's perspective matters to the story

**Why this works:**

Film festivals are hungry for quality immersive content. Players like L!VE are actively looking to hire creators who can bridge cinematic language and spatial technology. Your 120-second film becomes your calling card.

**What to focus on:**

- **Story first**: Does it work as a film, not just as a spatial experience?
- **Packaging matters: Your trailer and presentation are 30% of your score - make them count**
- **Use space intentionally**: Don't just spin the camera - give viewers a reason to look around
- **Keep it tight**: 120 seconds forces you to cut the fluff and nail the emotional core

### Inspiration 2 - 3D content or Spatial Narratives

Build an immersive narrative using 3D environments, spatial video, gaussian splats,  or volumetric capture

3D Content or Spatial Narratives

**Focus: Real-time 3D or Spatial Video Storytelling**

Build an immersive narrative using 3D environments, spatial video, gaussian splats,  or volumetric capture. This is about storytelling through depth, presence, and spatial design - not flat video wrapped around you.

**Ideas to explore:**

- Short narrative scene built in Unity/Unreal where depth enhances the story
- Spatial video piece (iPhone 15 Pro/Vision Pro) that uses foreground/background layers emotionally
- Volumetric capture performance - theater meets technology
- Mixed reality story that blends real and virtual elements in the same space
- Interactive narrative where the viewer's position in 3D space matters to the plot

**Why this works:**

Apple, Meta, and major studios are all investing in spatial storytelling, but don't have enough good content yet. You're building skills for formats that barely exist - that's where opportunity lives. Plus, spatial narratives can be experienced across multiple platforms (Quest, Vision Pro, WebXR, AndroidXR).

**What to focus on:**

- **Depth as storytelling tool**: Use 3D space to guide emotion and attention, not just because you can
- **Performance matters**: Real-time experiences need to run smoothly (min 60fps)
- **Natural interaction**: If viewers can move or interact, make it feel intuitive
- **Cinematic quality**: Good lighting, composition, and sound design still matter in 3D

### Inspiration 3 - Interactive Product Stories (Hiring Role)

Build an interactive 3D product viewer that tells a story through exploration.

Examples

- Sneaker viewer revealing design story through rotation
- AR furniture showing raw material to finished product
- Watch configurator exploring watchmaking heritage
- Car interior revealing engineering innovations

**Focus: 3D Product Integration with Narrative Design**

Build a functional 3D product experience that tells a story through interaction. 

This is about designing narrative moments into product visualization - where exploring the 3D model reveals something meaningful about the product, brand, or craft behind it.

**Ideas to explore:**

- Interactive 3D viewer where rotating/zooming reveals design story through hotspots or voiceover
- AR try-on experience that shows product journey (concept → creation → your hands) as you interact
- Virtual showroom where product placement and lighting changes tell brand heritage
- E-commerce product page where 3D customization unfolds the craftsmanship story
- 360° product experience with layered narrative (exterior beauty → interior engineering → human impact)

**Why this works:**

Brands are desperate for 3D product content that converts, but most viewers are bored with  tech demos. Add storytelling and you've got something that increases engagement AND dwell time. 

L!VE and major e-commerce platforms are actively looking for creators who can make products come alive through immersive design.

**What to focus on:**

- **Functional first**: This needs to work as a product viewer (high-quality 3D models, smooth performance, intuitive controls)
- **Story through interaction**: The narrative reveals itself as users explore, not forced cutscenes
- **Technical excellence**: High-res models (.glb/.usdz), 60fps minimum, works on target platform
- **Business value**: Could a brand actually use this? Does it help showcase products better?
